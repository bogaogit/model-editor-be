give me the structure of the page defined in the following text in a json format, with entity name and attribute name in title case (separated using space), and type, examples, and use target entity as type for tables:
So this page describes the details of a recorder. So first we have the name of the recorder, for example live a quarter room recorder. Then we have the version number of the recorder. For instance, version 0.17.81. Then we have the name of the host, for example desktop dash 92. Then we have the IP of the host, for example 1.92.168.0.4. Then following that we have the last heartbeat time. For instance, in this case is the last heartbeat over a week ago. Then we have the errors table. This table structure is like we displayed the error title first. Then followed by the error description. Then we have the documentation link.
